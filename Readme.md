# Projects
 
For your project, you need to create a Python notebook that contains an exploratory data analysis of a dataset.
 
You may choose one of the datasets from the list below, or from some other source. Your choice has to be approved by Chengchun.
 
Your notebook needs to demonstrate knowledge of applying the methods learned in the course (or outside this course), *covering both manipulating and visualizing data*. It will be expected from a notebook to tell a story and that the analysis is nicely presented.
 
Analysis of different datasets may require different amount of effort, which will be taken into account when grading submitted solutions.

## Criteria of evaluation

1. __Data manipulation__: use of different techniques for cleaning, reshaping or querying data studied in class.  
2. __Data visualization__: use of most efficient data visualization methods for the underlying goals. 
3. __Presentation__: overall organization of the notebook, story telling, general quality of presentation, use of both textual and graphical components, overall aesthetics and neatness, use of most efficient communication means, finding a good balance between using different methods and being concise and up to the point.

Please refer to the __Marking Rubric__ for details.

__Structure__ of a notebook: The notebook must start by summarizing what the goals of the study are and providing some background about the dataset and how this dataset can be used to address the asserted goals. It should then proceed through importing, cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, followed by an exploratory data analysis using data visualization and other means. The notebook may use different methods for managing and visualizing data, but try to find a balance between being exhaustive and efficient in using those that best serve your underlying goals. The notebook may use different data analysis methods, from basic exploratory data analysis using statistical and other plots to those using special methods such as dimensionality reduction, graph visualization, predictions, and other methods. The notebook must conclude with a section summarizing the main findings of the analysis.
