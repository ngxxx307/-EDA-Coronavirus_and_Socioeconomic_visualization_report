## 75/100 

### The report is well-written with many nice plots. The project shows the student has good understanding of the course materials and is capable of applying the techniques to real data for data cleaning, visualisation and analysis. 

* **Introduction and data description**: The introduction is a nice read. The topic is interesting. A good summary of the data is presented.
* **Formulation of the research question**: The research questions and the objectives can be explained further.
* **Data acquisition**: Multiple csv files from multiple sources, web scraping from wikipedia for provinces in China, Australia and Canada.
* **Data cleaning and reshaping**: Data cleaning includes merging data, removing and examining missing data and transformation (via the function apply). Reshaping the data using pivot table
* **Visualisation**: Appropriate use of heat map, map, line plot (with colour to represent different continents), violin plot, scatterplot and dimensional reduction
* **Modelling**: Linear regression with diagnostic plots, although more explanation can be given to explain what is doing in this section. For example, there is no text between the section 5 header and the code.
* **Conclusion and overall structure**: The conclusion section is well-written with reflection and highlight some possible issues with the analysis. The structure of the report is good.
